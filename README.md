Calculates the phase diagram for two component plasmas following [Medin & Cumming (2010)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PhRvE..81c6107M).

`free_energy.py` computes the free energy of liquid and solid phases (see section II of the paper for a description and references to the different free energy fits).

`phase_diagram.py` computes the phase diagram by searching for tangent points at different Gamma's. Red points indicate liquid / blue points solid. Here is an example for an O/Se mixture (compare Medin & Cumming 2010 Fig. 5b):
